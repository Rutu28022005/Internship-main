🌟My 1-Month Internship Journey at KANT IT, Rajkot

Hello everyone 👋,
I’m Rutu Sheladiya, and I had the wonderful opportunity to work as a Web Development Intern at KANT IT, Rajkot from 12th May 2025 to 12th June 2025.
This internship was my very first step into the professional world of development, and honestly, it felt like a rollercoaster of learning, challenges, and growth.

🚀 Starting the Journey

On the very first day, I was both excited and nervous. Excited because I was finally going to apply everything I had learned so far, and nervous because it was my first real experience working with industry-level projects.
My mentor at KANT IT guided me with a clear roadmap:

Begin with frontend fundamentals to polish the basics.
Move towards API integration and client-server communication.
Finally, step into full-stack development with a MERN project.
This structure really helped me pace my learning and stay motivated throughout the month.

🛠️ The Projects I Worked On

1️⃣ Amazon Clone (Frontend Basics)

The first week was all about frontend mastery. I created a clone of the Amazon homepage using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
It included product cards, a navigation bar, and a responsive layout.
I practiced Flexbox and Grid extensively.
For the first time, I saw how small details in CSS can make a big difference in UI.
This project gave me a solid foundation in layouts and interactivity.

2️⃣ Weather Website (APIs + React)

The second project pushed me beyond static websites. I built a Weather App using React.js with the OpenWeather API.
Users could check live weather updates by searching any city.
I learned to manage state with React hooks.
Handled errors for invalid city names (trust me, this part taught me a lot about debugging ).
I made sure it looked clean and worked on both desktop and mobile.
This project was special because it showed me the power of APIs and how frontend & backend work together.

3️⃣ Spotify Clone (Full-Stack MERN)

The highlight of my internship! 🎵
In the final weeks, I worked on a Spotify Clone using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js).
Implemented user authentication (login/signup).
Created and browsed playlists.
Stored user and music data in MongoDB.
Tested APIs with Postman and integrated them with React.

🌱 What I Learned Beyond Coding

This internship wasn’t just about writing code. I also learned:
How to think like a developer and break problems into smaller parts.
The importance of clean code, debugging, and documentation.
Managing deadlines and balancing multiple tasks.
How frontend, backend, and databases connect in real-world apps.
Most importantly, I gained confidence — the kind that only comes from building and shipping projects.

✨ Final Reflection

From cloning Amazon’s homepage 🛒 to fetching real-time weather data 🌦️ and finally building a Spotify-like platform 🎶, every step of this internship was a milestone in my learning journey.
It reaffirmed my passion for creating scalable, user-friendly digital solutions and reminded me why I chose to be in tech in the first place.
This is just the beginning — and I’m excited to keep learning, experimenting, and building. 🚀

I’m truly grateful to KANT IT, Rajkot for this opportunity. The guidance and support I received helped me explore my potential and push my limits.
This 1-month journey not only sharpened my technical skills but also gave me the confidence to tackle bigger challenges in the future.
